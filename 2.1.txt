Q1: In the threshold part, attempt 1 (Using single VTH to be a threshold) is not suitable coz lots of voltages like VTH +- Verror set extremely close to VTH and it's costly to distinguish. Attempt2, however, also has VH and VL, and the distinguish problem and cost alwasy exist, how to solve it?
Type: Long term application
  The goal of attempt 2 is not to better distinguish but a regulation on the circuit, that, any voltage as signal should be as far as they can to the forbidden range, if the approach happens, that is the circuit design error.

Q2: Why cannot we leave some ports empty in a combinational digital system?
Type: Long term application
  In the real world, the port left empty does not display the voltage as 0, but be effected by capacity/noise/nearby wire/temperature/power. Thus the output of the system would somehow become a random function.

Q3: Why do we forbid direct circle appears in the combinational digital system/component? What is the definition of direct circle?
Type: Abstraction
  The direct circle does not mean feedback or circuit circle composed by wire and resistors, it means in a CDS, from any logic element, its dependence diagram must be a directed acylic graph (DAG), that is you cannot set off from element A and pass B,C..... then in some node back to A.

Q4: What does tPD refers to, is it the longest delay in the whole circuit or in a specific line?
Type: Abstraction
  It is not a logic chain has a tPD but the whole circuit has a tPD, it refers to the worst case and the longest delay happens in the whole circuit.

Q5: While digital output always need a larger margin than digital input, after numbers of logic elements, wouldn't the margin become too big and out of range?
Type: Long term application
    No, it will not infinitely become bigger. The logic gate is a regenerative device rather than just pass. During each logic gate like CMOS interver, NMOS connected to GND, PMOS shifted off entirely, output voltage again close to GND.
