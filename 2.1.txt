Q1: In the threshold part, attempt 1 (Using single VTH to be a threshold) is not suitable coz lots of voltages like VTH +- Verror set extremely close to VTH and it's costly to distinguish. Attempt2, however, also has VH and VL, and the distinguish problem and cost alwasy exist, how to solve it?
Type: Long term application
  The goal of attempt 2 is not to better distinguish but a regulation on the circuit, that, any voltage as signal should be as far as they can to the forbidden range, if the approach happens, that is the circuit design error.
