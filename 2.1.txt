Q1: In the threshold part, attempt 1 (Using single VTH to be a threshold) is not suitable coz lots of voltages like VTH +- Verror set extremely close to VTH and it's costly to distinguish. Attempt2, however, also has VH and VL, and the distinguish problem and cost alwasy exist, how to solve it?
Type: Long term application
  The goal of attempt 2 is not to better distinguish but a regulation on the circuit, that, any voltage as signal should be as far as they can to the forbidden range, if the approach happens, that is the circuit design error.

Q2: Why cannot we leave some ports empty in a combinational digital system?
Type: Long term application
  In the real world, the port left empty does not display the voltage as 0, but be effected by capacity/noise/nearby wire/temperature/power. Thus the output of the system would somehow become a random function.

Q3: Why do we forbid direct circle appears in the combinational digital system/component? What is the definition of direct circle?
Type: Abstraction
  The direct circle does not mean feedback or circuit circle composed by wire and resistors, it means in a CDS, from any logic element, its dependence diagram must be a directed acylic graph (DAG), that is you cannot set off from element A and pass B,C..... then in some node back to A.
